Tools to facilitate predictionless volatility trading between currencies of similar characteristics.

The KrakenBalances.py program gives intuitive buy- and sell messages when a currency's value (measured in BTC) has risen or decreased by a given rate. The only thing this algorithm guarantees is an equal or increased amount of the weakest currency, but will in many cases where currencies of similar characteristics are involved, yield gains on multiple currencies.
